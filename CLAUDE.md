# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Workville is a team visualization tool that displays team members' work status as a virtual village with animated pixel-art characters. Team members can check in/out, take breaks, write work logs, and track their work hours with a leveling system.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime + Auth)
- **State**: Zustand for client state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4

### Database Schema
- `profiles`: User profiles with character selection and level tracking
- `work_sessions`: Check-in/out times and duration tracking
- `user_status`: Real-time status (working/home/break)
- `work_logs`: Daily work logs with markdown content
- `work_log_template`: Shared template for all users

### Authentication Flow
1. Supabase Auth handles email/password authentication
2. Middleware (`middleware.ts`) protects routes and enforces character selection
3. New users must select a character before accessing the main app
4. Profile and status records are auto-created via database triggers

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Server/Client Split**: Use server components by default, "use client" only for interactivity
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions for live status updates
- **Character System**: 4 character types, 3 states (working/home/break), 2 animation frames each
- **Grid Layout**: 9x7 CSS grid for village positioning (4 houses top, office center, break area bottom)

## Current Development Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- Basic project setup with all dependencies
- Database schema with RLS policies
- Authentication system with protected routes
- Character selection flow

ðŸš§ **Next Phase (Phase 3)**:
- Create village UI components (`components/village/`)
- Implement character animation system (PNG sprite cycling)
- Set up CSS grid layout for village

## Important Implementation Notes

### Supabase MCP Integration
When working with the database, use the Supabase MCP tool for direct database operations:
- `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` for queries
- `mcp__supabase__apply_migration` for schema changes

### Character Animation System
- Each character needs 6 PNG files: `{status}_{frame}.png`
- Animation cycles between 2 frames every 0.5 seconds
- Position transitions use CSS transitions for smooth movement

### State Management
- Use Zustand stores in `lib/stores/`
- Auth state is managed in `auth-store.ts`
- Village state will be in `village-store.ts` (to be created)

### Work Session Logic
- Check-in creates new `work_sessions` record
- Check-out updates record with duration and triggers work log modal
- Level calculation: `Math.floor(total_work_hours / 8) + 1`

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables in `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ostawzicicutfljphyvg.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your_anon_key]
``` 

 # Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

  When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
  context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

  ## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

  Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
   gemini command:

  ### Examples:

  **Single file analysis:**
  ```bash
  gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

  Multiple files:
  gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

  Entire directory:
  gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

  Multiple directories:
  gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

  Current directory and subdirectories:
  gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"
  
#
 Or use --all_files flag:
  gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

  Implementation Verification Examples

  Check if a feature is implemented:
  gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

  Verify authentication implementation:
  gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

  Check for specific patterns:
  gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"

  Verify error handling:
  gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

  Check for rate limiting:
  gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

  Verify caching strategy:
  gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

  Check for specific security measures:
  gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

  Verify test coverage for features:
  gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"

  When to Use Gemini CLI

  Use gemini -p when:
  - Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
  - Comparing multiple large files
  - Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
  - Current context window is insufficient for the task
  - Working with files totaling more than 100KB
  - Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
  - Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

  Important Notes

  - Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
  - The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
  - No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
  - Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
  - When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results # Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis
